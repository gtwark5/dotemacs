#+TITLE: README.org --- My personal GNU Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Geoff T. Wark

* Installation

Simply copy everything to your =.emacs.d= folder (be sure to backup your previous files). Check out [[file:config.org][config.org]] and [[file:init.el][init.el]] for more info! :^)

* !!For Windows Users!!

You will likely need to install some additional GNU packages for this config to even work at all. I needed to grab LibPng and GnuTLS at minimum. Follow these links to search for and download them (*SourceForge warning*):

- http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/

Just place the binaries into the same =bin= folder where your =runemacs.exe= is.
